> Configure project :app
WARNING: Using flatDir should be avoided because it doesn't support any meta-data formats.

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> Using '--release' option for JavaCompile is not supported because it prevents the Android Gradle plugin
  from setting up the bootclasspath for compiling Java source files against Android APIs
  (see https://issuetracker.google.com/278800528).
  Please use Java toolchain or set 'sourceCompatibility' and 'targetCompatibility' options instead.
  (see https://developer.android.com/build/jdks#source-compat).

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
> Get more help at https://help.gradle.org.
